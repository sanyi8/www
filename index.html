        <p class="lead">It's enough. This is still the best way. You go after him with a gun, you'll never get out of it
          alive. But with this... you slip it into his food or drink, there shouldn't be any taste or smell...
          thirty-six hours later... poof. A man <mark>his age, working as hard as he does... no one will be
            surprised</mark>. Mike can have his suspicions, but that's all they'll be. Please, one homicidal maniac at a
          time. </p>

        <p>Look, I'll give you Jesse Pinkman, OK? Like you said, he's the problem, he's always been the problem and
          without him, we would... <strong>and he's in town, alright?</strong> He's not in Virginia or wherever the hell
          you're looking for him. He's right here in Albuquerque and I can take you to him, I'll take you right to him.
          What do you say?</p>

        <p>It's complicated and I don't wish to discuss it. It's none of your concern. You know what, let's just say
          that I have a hell of a lot more on my mind, right now, than thinking about buying a damn car wash. Okay? So
          if you could just... please. </p>
